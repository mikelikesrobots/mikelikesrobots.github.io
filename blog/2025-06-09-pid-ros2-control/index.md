# Understanding PID Control in ROS 2

PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control is a fundamental control algorithm used in robotics and automation. Let's explore how it works and how to implement it in ROS 2.

## Interactive PID Control Visualization

Below is an interactive visualization of a PID controller's response. You can adjust the controller parameters using the sliders to see how they affect the system's behavior:

- **Proportional Gain (Kp)**: Controls how aggressively the system responds to the current error
- **Integral Gain (Ki)**: Helps eliminate steady-state error by accumulating past errors
- **Derivative Gain (Kd)**: Dampens the response and helps prevent overshooting

The blue line shows the system's response, while the red dashed line represents the target setpoint.

<PIDController initialKp={4.0} initialKi={0.0} initialKd={0.0} setpoint={1} initialValue={0} />

Try adjusting the sliders to see how different combinations of PID parameters affect the system's response. For example:
- Increasing Kp will make the system respond more quickly but may cause overshooting
- Increasing Ki will help eliminate steady-state error but may cause oscillation
- Increasing Kd will help dampen oscillations but may make the system more sensitive to noise

## How PID Control Works

The PID controller combines three control terms:

1. **Proportional (P)**: Provides an output proportional to the current error
2. **Integral (I)**: Accumulates past errors to eliminate steady-state error
3. **Derivative (D)**: Predicts future error based on the rate of change

The controller output is calculated as:

```
output = Kp * error + Ki * âˆ«error dt + Kd * d(error)/dt
```

Where:
- Kp is the proportional gain
- Ki is the integral gain
- Kd is the derivative gain
- error is the difference between setpoint and current value
