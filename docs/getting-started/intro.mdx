# Getting Started with Cloud Robotics

This guide is designed to help you use the cloud - and AWS in particular - to design and build a robot, from coming up with the initial idea all the way through to supporting your robots out in the wild! This guide will be updated over time as I'm able to build and upload new content, so keep checking back.

## How to use this guide

Each category shows how a different technology can be supported using the cloud, both in development and in production. Resources in each category will link to blog posts, YouTube videos, and any other content that will help with that category, including providing guidance on AWS services that can assist.

If you use all of the knowledge here, you could end up with a scalable management system in the cloud for onboarding, monitoring, and controlling robots anywhere in the world (with an internet connection!).
